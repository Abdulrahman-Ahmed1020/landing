          <h2>Religion in Egypt</h2>
          <p>
            Religion in Egypt controls many aspects of social life and is
            endorsed by law. The state religion of Egypt is Islam. Although
            estimates vary greatly in the absence of official statistics. Since
            the 2006 census religion has been excluded, and thus available
            statistics are estimates made by religious and non-governmental
            agencies. The country is majority Sunni Muslim (estimated to be
            85-95% of the population), with the next largest religious group
            being Coptic Orthodox Christians (with estimates ranging from 5-
            15%[note 1]). The exact numbers are subject to controversy, with
            Christians alleging that they have been systemically under-counted
            in existing censuses.Religion in Egypt (2019) Islam (official)
            (90.3%) Christianity (9.6%) Other (0.1%) Egypt hosts two major
            religious institutions. Al-Azhar Mosque, founded in AD 970 by the
            Fatimids as the first Islamic university in Egypt and the Coptic
            Orthodox Church of Alexandria established in the middle of the 1st
            century by Saint Mark. In Egypt, Muslims and Christians share a
            common history, national identity, ethnicity, race, culture, and
            language. A common religious scene in Egypt: a mosque next to a
            church. In 2002, under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas
            (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday, though Christians
            complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state
            security and public office, and of being discriminated against in
            the workforce on the basis of their religion.

          <h2>Demographics</h2>
          <p>
            In 2010, based on the contested 2006 Census data, estimated that
            94.9% of Egyptians are Muslims, 5.1% are Christians, and less than
            1% are Jewish, Buddhists, or other religions. The share of
            Christians in the Egyptian population has according to official
            statistics been declining with the highest share reported in the
            past century being in 1927, when the official census put the
            percentage of Egyptian Christians at 8.3%. In each of the seven
            subsequent censuses, the percentage shrank, ending at 5.7% in 1996.
            However, most Christians refuted these figures, claiming they have
            been under-counted. Christians maintain that they represent up to 15
            or even 25% of the Egyptian population. In 2017 state-owned
            newspaper Al Ahram claimed that the percentage of Christians ranged
            from 10 to 15%, similar to the range claimed by the Washington
            Institute for Near East Policy. Recent self-identification surveys
            put the Christian percentage at around 10%, as found by
            Afrobarometer in 2016 (which estimated the country to be 10.3%
            Christian and 89.4% Muslim) and by Arab Barometer in 2019 (which
            estimated it to be 9.6% Christian and 90.3% Muslim). According to
            2015 figures from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Sunni
            Muslims make up 90% of the population, with Christians making up the
            remaining 10%. A significant number of Sunni Muslims follow native
            Sufi orders. There are reportedly close to fifty thousand Ahmadi
            Muslims in Egypt. Estimates of Egypt's Shia Twelvers and Ismaili
            community range from 800,000 to about two to three million members.
            Most Egyptian Christians belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church
            of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian church. Other
            Christian denominations include Armenian Apostolic, Catholic,
            Maronite and Anglican. The Greek Orthodox number between
            250–350,000. The most recent declarations, made by Pope Shenouda III
            and bishop Morkos of Shubra in 2008, claimed that the number of
            Orthodox Christians in Egypt was over 12 million. Other estimates
            made by church officials put this number at 16 million. The Coptic
            Orthodox Church claimed that these figures are based on regularly
            updated membership records. Protestant churches claim a membership
            of about 300,000 Egyptians, and the Coptic Catholic Church is
            estimated to have similar membership figures. These figures would
            put the percentage of Christians in Egypt between 10% and 20% of the
            total population. There is a small but historically significant
            non-immigrant population of the Baháʼí Faith, with estimates in 2008
            placing the number at around 2,000 people, along with a far smaller
            community of Jews, with an estimated 13 adherents in 2014 (down from
            80,000 prior to the 1953 dissolution of the monarchy and persecution
            during the decades long Arab–Israeli conflict); an unknown number of
            Egyptians will openly identify as atheist and agnostic, since public
            expressions of irreligion risk harassment and legal sanctions.

          <h2>Freedom of religion and human rights</h2>
          <p>
            Freedom of belief and worship are formally recognized as absolute by
            the Egyptian Constitution under Article 64, but are effectively
            limited by government intervention and sectarian conflict. Some
            aspects of the country's laws are heavily founded on Islamic
            principles. Egyptian authorities only recognize Judaism, Islam and
            Christianity, allowing them public worship unlike other faiths.
            President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and other senior figures have
            emphasized religious tolerance. In 2019, Sisi's cabinet approved a
            number of churches. Authorities however, have often failed to
            sanction or take stringent action against mobs who have indulged in
            violence against Christians. While construction of mosques is freely
            allowed by the authorities without any intervention, they have
            sometimes let mob rule dictate that even registered churches be
            closed down. Christians have also been consistently targeted by
            Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Contempt or blasphemy against a
            religion can be charged under section 98 (f) of the Egyptian Penal
            Code. Conversion from Islam to any other faith is not recognized
            officially, though issues have also occurred for those converting to
            Islam. The government also discriminates against Islamic religious
            minority groups, most notably Shi'a Muslims, who face open official
            discrimination, including being barred from admission to Al-Azhar
            University.[citation needed] In 2006 Egypt's Supreme Administrative
            Court made a clear legal distinction between "recognized religions"
            (i.e., Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) and all other religious
            beliefs. This ruling effectively delegitimizes and forbids practice
            of all but the three Abrahamic religions,[37] and made it necessary
            for non-Abrahamic religious communities to either commit perjury or
            be denied Egyptian identification cards (see Egyptian identification
            card controversy), until a 2008 Cairo court case ruled that
            unrecognized religious minorities may obtain birth certificates and
            identification documents, so long as they omit their religion on
            court documents.

          <h2>Ancient Egyptian religion</h2>
          <p>
            Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic
            beliefs and rituals that formed an integral part of ancient Egyptian
            culture. It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many
            deities believed to be present in, and in control of the world.
            Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to
            gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the
            pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by
            virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between
            their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods
            through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the
            order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos. The state
            dedicated enormous resources to religious rituals and to the
            construction of temples. Individuals could interact with the gods
            for their own purposes, appealing for help through prayer or
            compelling the gods to act through magic. These practices were
            distinct from, but closely linked with, the formal rituals and
            institutions. The popular religious tradition grew more prominent
            over the course of Egyptian history as the status of the pharaoh
            declined. Egyptian belief in the afterlife and the importance of
            funerary practices is evident in the great efforts made to ensure
            the survival of their souls after death – via the provision of
            tombs, grave goods and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits
            of the deceased. The religion had its roots in Egypt's prehistory
            and lasted for 3,500 years. The details of religious belief changed
            over time as the importance of particular gods rose and declined,
            and their intricate relationships shifted. At various times, certain
            gods became preeminent over the others, including the sun god Ra,
            the creator god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. For a brief
            period, in the theology promulgated by the pharaoh Akhenaten, a
            single god, the Aten, replaced the traditional pantheon. Ancient
            Egyptian religion and mythology left behind many writings and
            monuments, along with significant influences on ancient and modern
            cultures.
